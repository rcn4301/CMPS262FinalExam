In playing with things over the course of the last week and a half, I've ended up with an app that sort of does what you're looking for, but I've hit a couple of roadblocks in that I've ended up with two search bars where the song and the artist are both needed in order to get a result. 

However, I took the liberty of adding some components to this app that I wanted to work into the cocktail app but didn't have the time, such as a favorites listing and basic animation, including album art. These were pretty much written before I started on this app, but I took a little time to integrate them into this code. 

For a result that is sure to work re. testing, I recommend searching "Get Back" by the Beatles. 

I tried to add a function where if there isn't a song to display, then a quote by Kanye West would appear (I found a fun little API for that a few weeks ago that I was considering working into the cocktail app) but I haven't quite got that working. 

Thanks for a great semester, I'll see you in the Fall Semester for CMPS 364!
